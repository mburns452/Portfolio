This is a portfolio to display my coding skills and is a work in progress.

I am a recent college graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Game Development with a focus on coding. I am the most proficient in Java and that is what most, if not all, of these projects will be created with. 
I also learned a small bit of C# when using Unity during my schoolwork.
